<h1><b>Why Are Type Guards Necessary? Discuss Various Types of Type Guards and Their Use Cases</b></h1>

<p><b>Type Guards</b> are essential in TypeScript for narrowing down types and ensuring that operations are type-safe. Type guards help determine the exact type of a variable within a given scope, enabling the programmer to avoid runtime errors. Here, we discuss why type guards are necessary and examine different types with practical use cases.</p>

<h3><b>Why Are Type Guards Necessary?</b></h3>
<p>In TypeScript, data structures and variables can have types that are unions or intersections of several possible types. Without type guards, it can be challenging to know the exact type at runtime, especially with complex data structures. Type guards allow us to "guard" our code against invalid type access, making TypeScript more efficient, less error-prone, and easier to debug.</p>

<h3><b>Types of Type Guards and Their Use Cases</b></h3>
<h4><b>1. typeof:</b></h4>
<p>This is the most basic type guard, used with primitive types like string, number, and boolean</p>
<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
<pre><code>function logValue(value: string | number) {
    if (typeof value === "string") {
        console.log("String value:", value.toUpperCase());
    } else {
        console.log("Number value:", value.toFixed(2));
    }
}</code></pre>

<h4><b>2. instanceof:</b></h4>
<p>Used to check if an object is an instance of a particular class, particularly useful with class-based inheritance.</p>
<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
<pre><code>class Animal {
    speak() {
        console.log("Animal speaking...");
    }
}
class Dog extends Animal {
    bark() {
        console.log("Woof!");
    }
}
function communicate(animal: Animal) {
    if (animal instanceof Dog) {
        animal.bark();
    } else {
        animal.speak();
    }
}</code></pre>

<h4><b>3. User-Defined:</b></h4>
<p>Custom functions that return a boolean, with a specific return type x is Y. These are especially useful with more complex types and interfaces</p>
<h4><b>Example</b></h4>
<pre><code>interface Fish {
    swim: () => void;
}
interface Bird {
    fly: () => void;
}
function isFish(pet: Fish | Bird): pet is Fish {
    return (pet as Fish).swim !== undefined;
}
function move(animal: Fish | Bird) {
    if (isFish(animal)) {
        animal.swim();
    } else {
        animal.fly();
    }
}</code></pre>

<h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
<p>Type guards are invaluable in TypeScript, enabling safe and accurate operations on variables with multiple types. They improve readability and reduce runtime errors, making TypeScript a powerful tool for large-scale applications.</p>
